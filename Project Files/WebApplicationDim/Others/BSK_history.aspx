                        Bishwo Shahitto Kendro today is not a mere institution. It is today a nation-wide movement, a humble assurance of an enlightened national psyche – a lively world meant for flourishing into a higher power and humanity through comprehensive practice and exercise of human knowledge along with enrichment of mind and diverse activities of life.

                        17 December 1978 saw the coming together of a small reading circle initiated by Bishwo Sahitto Kendro. The fifteen member of the circle gathered at the small auditorium of the Education Extension Centre (now known as NAEM) behind Dhaka College. They decided to hold a meeting once every week, choose a book to read during the rest of the week, and reconvene on the same day the following week to hold a discussion on it. The aim was to discover the riches the book offered, and share the insights and emotions the books conveyed, so that the members’ collective would enrich them and contribute meaningfully towards human development.<br />
                        After five years, the circle’s multiplying membership and its success in achieving its goals led the organizers believe that if the ideals and set up of the reading circle are replicated in each school, college and university of the country, it would certainly lead to a wave of enlightenment involving thousands of young men and women. The very prospect of such an upsurge in the nation’s spirit was uplifting. It made the organizer work with renewed dedication.<br />
                        Today, the reading circle that began with only 15 members has become a phenomenon, involving one a half million members. The structure and programs of the reading circle have evolved over time to take a more organized and institutional look, but the informing spirit still remains the same.

                        Bishwo Sahitto Kendro is not a barren academic institution bound by rigid rules and structures; instead it is a world with an atmosphere full of life and energy that celebrates the awakening and enlightenment of the human spirit amidst the pleasures of learning and the struggles of life<br />
                        Bishwo Sahitto Kendro is an arena that welcomes the arrival of enlightened, cultured and sophisticated individuals, who are capable of changing the world around them with their natural inquisitiveness, creativity and positivity, along with their insatiable thirst for knowledge

                        Twenty five hundred years ago, in Greece, during the time of Pericles, the youth turning into eighteen years of age had to make a promise in a state ceremony for them. They had to pronounce, in front of everyone, “I would do something in my life so that at the time of my death, I would leave behind an Athens which would be better than what I got at the time of my birth”. Similarly, our effort is also for a better Bangladesh.<br />
