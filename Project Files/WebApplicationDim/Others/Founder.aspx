                    As a distinguished writer he has over 40 highly acclaimed books of poetry, essays, short stories, drama, translations, autobiographical writings, travelogue, etc. to his credit. As a TV personality he has anchored educational and entertainment programs ever since TV had been introduced in this country in 1964. His thoughtful, refined, sophisticated, witty and spontaneous presentation always won absolute praise and admiration all over the country.<br />
                        All the facets of his personality have been combined in his role as founder and organizer of Bishwo Shahitto Kendro (World-Literature Centre). With great dedication he participated in the huge task of nation building after the independence of Bangladesh and realized the need for developing hundreds and thousands of individuals who would be visionaries, with high moral values, enlightened, aware and effective and give meaningful leadership in all aspects of national life.<br />
                        Keeping this in mind and observing the decline of the nation morally and intellectually, Prof. Abdullah Abu Sayeed, with his visionary ideas and in-depth understanding of the task, established the Bishwo Shahitto Kendro (BSK) with the goal to create an informed, enriched and committed generation of future citizens for Bangladesh. Since its inception in 1978, the BSK, a nation-wide educational and cultural organization, is operating various non-conventional and informal enrichment programs in its own premises as well as at several thousand educational institutions to create an environment for the sensitive, eager and impressionable young students to develop into enlightened individuals. Through its unique programs BSK has kindled more than four million young minds in schools, colleges and universities to read great books of the world, take part in various cultural and literary activities, think, interact and enlighten themselves with cross-cultural enrichment and understanding. Prof. Sayeed's creativity led him introduce another unique program – the Nation-wide Mobile Library network which reaches readers at 1900 spots in 250 upazilas of 58 districts of Bangladesh. All these efforts are reinforced by BSK's publications, cultural and various types of audio-visual programs. A massive expansion program of the BSK activities which was undertaken in 2007 is now supporting over 1000,000 people, mostly students.<br />
                        Versatile and charismatic, Prof. Sayeed is also an outstanding environmental activist. As a vice-president of Bangladesh Paribesh Andalon (Bangladesh Environment Movement) he took active part in movements against air pollution of Dhaka Metropolis (1998-2003), water pollution of rivers especially those surrounding Dhaka city (2000-2009) as well as against illegal acquisition of lakes, parks and water-bodies (2000-2007) with great success. During the widespread dengue epidemic in Dhaka in 1999-2001 his active role created mass-awareness among city population through his regular presence in print and electronic media, lecturing in educational institutions and undertaking various dengue prevention programs.<br />
                        Amiable and caring, Prof. Abdullah Abu Sayeed is an idealist and a dreamer. He works to the best of his ability and sincerity. His passion for literature and his firm conviction that exposure to great literary, philosophical and other great works of human civilization together with aesthetic refinement will foster what he calls "enlightened" humans and makes us believe that someday, through our relentless and untiring efforts, we will certainly be able to build a better world for all.<br />
